    <h1>SYMPTOMS OF OBESITY</h1>

    <p>Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat.- Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It is a medical problem that increases your risk of other diseases and health problems, such as</p>

   <p>Difficulty in sleeping.- Obesity is associated with sleep apnoea, which is the cause of daytime drowsiness and insufficient restful sleep.</p>

   <p>Back and/or joint pains.-
    Prolonged, excess pressure on the joints will cause inflammation. But recent research suggests that inflammation may be a risk factor rather than a consequence. Obesity may increase inflammation levels in the body, which may lead to joint pain.
    According to the American Obesity Association, back pain affects nearly one-third of people classified as obese. When your body carries extra weight—especially around the midsection—that weight pulls your pelvis forward. Every extra pound adds strain to back muscles and ligaments.

       <p>Excessive sweating.-
        Overweight and obesity are among the main conditions related to hyperhidrosis, probably due to the reduced heat loss caused by the thick subcutaneous adipose tissue layer, which may lead to a compensatory response characterized by the excessive production of sweat.

       <p>Intolerance to heat.-
        Obesity. Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to retain more heat. Sudden temperature changes. If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion.

   <p>Infections in skin folds.-
    Candidal Intertrigo/Perineal Dermatitis
    Patients with obesity have excessive fat folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat. Skin conditions commonly occurring in skin folds include intertrigo, yeast dermatitis, and fissures.

        <p>Fatigue.-
            The primary underlying mechanism that makes obese people feel overly tired is likely low-grade chronic inflammation. Fat cells, particularly from abdominal fat, produce immune compounds called cytokines that promote sleepiness, among other effects

        <p>Depression.-
            Obesity can cause poor self-image, low self-esteem, and social isolation, all known contributors to depression. Those who are obese can also find themselves ostracized, stereotyped, and discriminated against.

        <p>Feeling of shortness of breath (dyspnoea)-
            People who are overweight or obese often suffer shortness of breath due to excess fat in and around the chest which impedes breathing. Shallow, inadequate breathing is common in people with obesity and this makes exercise more difficult
